This is a sample text for the affine Caesar cipher lab work. The affine cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where each letter in an alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a letter.

The formula used is E(x) = (ax + b) mod m, where:
- x is the numeric value of a letter (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25)
- a and b are the key values (a must be coprime with m)
- m is the size of the alphabet (26 for English)

Despite its historical significance, the affine cipher is not secure by modern standards as it can be easily broken with frequency analysis.
